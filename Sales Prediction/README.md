# Project Title: Sales Prediction Model

## Introduction:

Shopping malls and Big Marts use various data management systems to keep track of their sales, inventory, and consumer information. This data is essential in forecasting future demand and making informed decisions about inventory management. Data warehousing is a commonly used approach to manage such vast amounts of data. Data warehouses store historical and current data in a centralized location, which can be analyzed to gain insights into customer behavior, sales patterns, and inventory management.

This project aims to build a solution for predicting the sales of different stores of a shop using historical sales data. The solution uses machine learning techniques to train a model on the provided dataset and then uses this model to make predictions for future sales.

## Problem Statement:

The problem addressed in this project is the need to predict the sales of different stores of a shop using historical sales data. Without accurate sales predictions, inventory management becomes challenging, leading to overstocking or understocking of products, which can result in decreased profits and customer dissatisfaction. By building a sales prediction model using machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide a solution that can forecast future sales for different stores and items, enabling the shop to adjust inventory levels accordingly and ensure optimal stock availability.

## Objective
To build a solution that should able to predict the sales of the different stores of the shop according to the provided dataset

## Getting Started:
To run the Fraud Transaction Detection System, you need to have the following installed on your system:

-   Python 3.6 or above
-   Required Python Libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
-   Data Warehouse with client data

## Installation

#### **1)** Creating conda environment
```bash
conda create -p env python==3.9 -y
```

#### **2)** Activing conda environment
```bash
source activate ./env
```
#### **3)** Installing all dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:

-   Configure the system with the data warehouse
-   Start the system
-   The system will monitor the transactions in real-time and detect any fraudulent activities
-   The system will notify the admin of any detected fraudulent activities
