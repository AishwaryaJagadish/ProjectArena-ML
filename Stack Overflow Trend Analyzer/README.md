# Programming Language Popularity Analysis

This project analyzes the popularity and trends of programming languages using Stack Overflow data. It explores the programming languages used and desired by developers based on survey responses, and visualizes the popularity of the top 10 languages.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Stack Overflow survey data, which can be obtained from [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). The dataset should include columns that capture the programming languages used or desired by the survey respondents, such as 'LanguageWorkedWith' and 'LanguageDesireNextYear'. 

Make sure to download the dataset and specify the file path in the code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/programming-language-popularity-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd programming-language-popularity-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the Stack Overflow survey data file in the project directory.

2. Open the Python script `analyze_popularity.py` and update the following line with the name of your dataset file:

   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('stackoverflow_survey_data.csv')
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```
   python analyze_popularity.py
   ```

4. The script will calculate the popularity of programming languages and generate a bar chart visualization of the top 10 popular languages.

5. The chart will be displayed and saved as an image file in the project directory.

## Results

The project provides insights into the popularity of programming languages based on the Stack Overflow survey data. The bar chart visualization showcases the top 10 programming languages along with their corresponding popularity counts.
