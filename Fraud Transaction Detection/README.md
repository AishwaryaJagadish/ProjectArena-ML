# Project Title: Fraud Transaction Detection System

## Introduction:

Shopping malls and Big Marts use various data management systems to keep track of their sales, inventory, and consumer information. This data is essential in forecasting future demand and making informed decisions about inventory management. Data warehousing is a commonly used approach to manage such vast amounts of data. Data warehouses store historical and current data in a centralized location, which can be analyzed to gain insights into customer behavior, sales patterns, and inventory management.

The Fraud Transaction Detection System is an advanced data analysis system that leverages data mining and machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. By analyzing the data store in the data warehouse, this system can identify anomalies and patterns that could indicate fraudulent activities. This system is designed to prevent financial losses by detecting fraudulent transactions and taking appropriate action to prevent them.

## Problem Statement:

The Fraud Transaction Detection System is designed to address the problem of detecting fraudulent activities in real-time on client data. Shopping malls and Big Marts collect vast amounts of consumer and sales data, which is stored in data warehouses. However, the data warehouse is susceptible to fraudulent activities, and it can be challenging to detect such activities manually. The system aims to identify fraudulent activities by analyzing the data store from the data warehouse using data mining and machine learning algorithms.

The primary objective of the system is to prevent financial losses by detecting fraudulent activities in real-time. This system can help shopping malls and Big Marts to identify patterns and anomalies in the data store, which could indicate fraudulent activities. By detecting these fraudulent activities, the system can take appropriate action to prevent financial losses.

## Objective
To build a solution that should able to predict the sales of the different stores of the shop according to the provided dataset

## Getting Started:
To run the Fraud Transaction Detection System, you need to have the following installed on your system:

-   Python 3.6 or above
-   Required Python Libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
-   Data Warehouse with client data

## Installation:
